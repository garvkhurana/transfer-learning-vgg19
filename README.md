Transfer Learning with VGG19 for Image Classification
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification using transfer learning with VGG19 architecture. Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point and then fine-tuned on a specific task. In this case, we leverage the VGG19 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, to classify images into predefined classes.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
Dataset
The model is trained and evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large-scale dataset consisting of millions of labeled images across thousands of categories. The dataset is widely used for training and benchmarking deep learning models.

Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on the VGG19 architecture, which is a deep convolutional neural network consisting of 19 layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The pre-trained VGG19 model is loaded and the fully connected layers are replaced with custom layers suitable for the target task.
